                            Most of us sometimes forget the reach that an image or any file shared on the networks can have, and the truth is that once we share it we lose "ownership" of it, we do not receive a notification telling us what the person who received it did, whether they deleted it, shared it, saved it, etc. Basically, we lose track of it, which is one of the characteristics of cyberbullying, and is related to the loss of the "right to be forgotten", which means that the victim continues to suffer indefinitely as they are unable to ensure the complete elimination of the information.
                            There are different ways in which a cyberbullying situation can develop depending on the type of harassment by the bully:

                        The consequences that cyberbullying can have on each of the associated roles are: for the victim, humiliation that lasts over time due to viralisation; for the bully, if detected, there is a record of their actions and their profile is associated with what has happened both in the present and in the future; for the spectators, if they are directly involved in the aggression, they can also be affected in some way.
                        Before developing the end of the definition with some tips, we would like to explain one of the problems that often exists when dealing with the concept of bullying/ciberbullying nowadays, and that is that the concept can be very "unspecific", and is not often used correctly, the misinterpretation of any situation as "bullying" can make the real cases lose strength or end up going unnoticed, "If everything is bullying nothing is bullying", a phrase closely related to Foucault's concept of normalisation.
